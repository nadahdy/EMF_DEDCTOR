# EMF_DEDCTOR

An EMF (electromagnetic field) meter is a device used to measure electromagnetic radiation in a given area. EMF meters are used to detect and measure the strength of electromagnetic fields emitted by various sources, such as electrical appliances, power lines, wireless devices, and other electronic equipment. 
EMF meters are commonly used in scientific research, industrial and commercial settings, as well as in residential areas to assess potential health risks associated with prolonged exposure to high levels of electromagnetic radiation. EMF meters can also be used by individuals who are concerned about their personal exposure to electromagnetic fields, especially those who suffer from electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS). 

As I mentioned before, the device is very simple to build and consists of several components: 
- Arduino Nano Microcontroller 
- SH1106(or SSD1306) Oled display 
- and Buzzer 
- E07 - M1010 pin antenna

  And finally, the device is installed in a suitable box made of PLA filament material.
